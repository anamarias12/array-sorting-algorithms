# Sorting Algorithm for Integer Arrays

We implement 3 sorting algorithms for integer arrays.

## Bubble Sort

The Bubble Sort algorithm sorts the array in ascending order.

The algorithm is implemented in C.

## Radix Sort

Radix sort is an integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping the keys by individual digits that share the same significant position and value.

The algorithm is implemented in C.
